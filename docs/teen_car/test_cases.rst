   Test Case Specification for Distance Detection Algorithm:

   Objective: Validate the functionality and performance of the distance detection algorithm to ensure accurate distance measurement and collision warning capabilities.

   Test Cases:

   :np:`(TC1)Input Validation`
       Verify that the algorithm handles invalid sensor data inputs gracefully.
   :np:`(TC2)Dynamic Threshold Adjustment`
       Confirm that the algorithm adjusts detection thresholds based on vehicle speed effectively.
   :np:`(TC3)Collision Warning Triggering`
       Test collision warning notifications are triggered when objects are within the predefined proximity threshold.
   :np:`(TC4)Accuracy Verification`
       Validate distance measurements against known distances to ensure accuracy within Â±5% tolerance.
   :np:`(TC5)Real-Time Processing`
       Evaluate algorithm performance under real-time processing constraints, ensuring timely collision warnings.
   :np:`(TC6)Sensor Fusion Integration`
       Validate the integration of multiple sensor data for improved accuracy and reliability.
   :np:`(TC7)Fault Tolerance`
       Verify error handling mechanisms in response to sensor failures or data inconsistencies.
   :np:`(TC8)Interface Compatibility`
       Ensure seamless integration with the car's control system and HMI through API testing.
   :np:`(TC9)Configuration Flexibility`
       Test configurable parameters to adapt the algorithm to different driving environments and preferences.
   :np:`(TC10)Compliance Testing`
       Validate adherence to automotive safety standards, including ISO 26262, through compliance testing.

   Expected Results:
        Each test case should result in the algorithm meeting the specified requirements outlined in the software specification.
        Any deviations or failures should be documented and addressed accordingly during the software development process.

   This test case specification outlines the test scenarios and expected results to validate the functionality, performance, and compliance of the distance detection algorithm for automotive applications.
